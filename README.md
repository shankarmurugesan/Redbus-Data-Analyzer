Key Features
1. Web Scraping with Selenium
Automates the extraction of bus route and schedule information directly from the Redbus website, ensuring up-to-date data collection.

2. Data Storage in MySQL
Efficiently stores the scraped data in a structured MySQL database, enabling quick and flexible data retrieval for further analysis.

3. Interactive Streamlit Application
Offers a user-friendly interface where users can filter and analyze bus service data based on various criteria such as bus type, route, price range, star rating, and seat availability.

4. Data Analysis and Visualization
Provides clear and actionable insights through data visualizations, helping users make informed decisions about their travel options.

Technologies Used
Selenium: For web scraping and browser automation.
MySQL: For robust and scalable data storage.
SQLAlchemy: For managing database connections and executing SQL queries.
Streamlit: For building an interactive web application that allows users to filter and visualize the data.
Python: The primary programming language used for scripting, data manipulation, and application development.
Project Objectives
1. Automate Data Extraction
Develop a reliable and efficient method to scrape bus service data from the Redbus website.

2. Systematic Data Storage
Organize the scraped data in a MySQL database, facilitating easy access and management.

3. Create a User-Friendly Interface
Build a Streamlit application that allows users to interact with the data, apply filters, and gain insights through visualizations.

4. Provide Valuable Insights
Enable users to analyze bus service data based on various criteria, helping them make better travel decisions.

Sample Output
Include some screenshots or GIFs of the Streamlit application in action, demonstrating the filtering options, data visualizations, and how users can interact with the platform.

This project combines the power of web scraping, data storage, and interactive data visualization to create a comprehensive tool for exploring bus services. It is designed to be both functional and accessible, making it easier for users to find the information they need efficiently.
